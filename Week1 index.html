                <td><strong>Greatest Failure</strong></td>
                <td>Early on in my career, during an organizational project at a leading wine company, a peer consultant in my team ask me to take over 2 of his initiatives that he was currently working on. These initiatives were related to my current workstream but I had not worked before with its main counterpart from the client's side, wich was a senior executive</td>
                <td>I went to the first meeting with the executive by myself without much preparation, thinking that it was going to be a simple kick-off and planning session for the next weeks, as all my other meetings during the past weeks had been. But, his expectations were completely different from mine. He thought it was time to start showing results and progress in the implementation of the initiative. He was very dissapointed to learn that it was not going to be the case and left the meeting in a clear bad mood. </td>
                <td>I knew I had failed in doing a correct onboarding with the initiative, such as understanding who the client was, what was his point of view on our project, specifically in the initiative under his responsibility and what was the current status of the current meeting. </td>
                <td>After the meeting I was decided to change this first impression and worked hard in two things: (1) Understand the history of interactions with the executive. I asked my manager and the other consultant to give my a detailed brief of him and also asked other client members about him in order to get the full picture, and (2) Decided to put some extra effort in the following days in order to get things going with the initiative and be able to present satisfactory results in our next meeting </td>
                <td>This expierence helped me to learn 3 thigns. First, the importance of knowing well your audience. Second, carefully preparing every meeting in order to match the client's expectations. Third, ask every detail when getting onboarded on a new matter in order to hit the ground running. </td>

                <td><strong>Leadership Experience</strong></td>
                <td>During an organizational project at a global leading wine company, I led a worstream that among other things was looking to fing optimization opportunities in the current workforce. It was the first time Matrix had worked with the client, so the pressure was to excel. </td>
                <td>After the first few weeks of travelling to meet all the winemakers and get to know each one of the 12 wineries, one thing became clear to me: the wineries needed to hire more full-time workers to cover critical positions during the harvest season. The problem was that this meant changing the scope of the project, but I was convinced it was the best solution for the client.</td>
                <td>It implied convincing Matrix’s senior team of this one day before the meeting in which we would show our initial findings. I informed my superiors of my findings and why I was convinced my proposal was the best for the company.
                    Once my superiors were on board, I had to convince a skeptical Human Resources team who were not happy with the idea of increasing their payroll. To secure their buy in, I led meetings between the HR team and the winemakers to discuss its benefits and consequences and worked closely with HR in identifying the critical positions during
                    harvest season and in calculating the number of new full-time workers needed for each winery.</td>
                <td>In the meeting with the CEO we managed to convince him to accept the change by presenting our arguments and data that proved it would secure his objective of improving productivity and avoiding operational risks.</td>
                <td>The greatest lesson I learned was to be brave and trust that with good arguments, data and solid relationships with key stakeholders, I could prove that a proposal that seemed counterintuitive was the best option to create lasting value. It made me trust my capacity to take calculated risks motivated by doing what is best for the client</td>

                <td>Nestle doesn’t hire management consulting firms worldwide, so the project was very important for both our client and for us, which put a lot of pressure on the team in order to deliver results. </td>
                <td>The analysis involved the marketing side of the business such as: using Nielsen information of competitors market share and price points, understanding consumer trends, product development, advertising budget and strategy, etc. Talking to main supermarkets chains in order to understand what they where doing right and wrong</td>
                <td>Our final deliverable found opportunities in three main areas: 
                    •	Reduce fixed costs on the factory by enabling a flexible workforce. 
                    •	Optimize the primary and secondary distribution costs to clients.

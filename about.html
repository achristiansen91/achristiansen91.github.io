        <strong>Pitch:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        My name is Alex. I am originally from Santiago, Chile. During my life, I have always been passionate about driving change in the most impactful industries that I can put my hands on. It was for this reason that I decided to study Industrial Engineering with a major in Mining Engineering for my undergrad. I wanted to learn about the most important industry of my country, which is mining and currently represents more than 25% of the GDP of Chile. 
But at the moment I graduated in 2015, I knew that only having highly technical skills was not enough to drive the change I was looking for. After talking to people, I decided that I needed to complement my engineering background with business knowledge and management skills in order to be able to help solve the most complex challenges that the mining industry was facing.

<p>
So, I got a job in a Latin American management consulting firm called Matrix Consulting. During my first years as a management consultant, I had the chance to work with several companies in different industries developing their strategy, designing their organizational system, and implementing operational excellence programs. This experience help me improve my problem solving skills and communication skills, and was exposed to senior executives and even board of directors of some of the largest firms in Latin America and Chile, which gave me valuable insights on how they thought and operated their businesses.

After two years, I was promoted to senior consultant and I took this opportunity to focus on learning how to effectively lead and motivate cross functional teams. In addition, it was during those couple of years that I experienced first hand the disruption that technology was generating in several industries. For example, in a particular project, I was responsible of developing a new business model for adopting autonomous trucks in mining. It was after that project that I knew that I wanted to contribute to the future of the tech industry. So I decided to pursue an MBA at Kellogg to learn more about the tech industry and enhance my leadership skills in a team based approach.

Microsoft represents a unique opportunity to be part of the most valuable tech company in the world, wich will allow me to broaden my global business perspective and to drive change on how millions of businesses and people around the world operate.
